American Sweetgum,Liquidambar styraciflua,Liquidambar,Hamamelidaceae,"This deciduous tree is distinguished by its prickly seed balls and beautiful fall colors. The Sweetgum got its name because the cut bark exudes a sweet, fragrant liquid used to make perfumes. It often is mistaken for a maple because the leaves are similar. The Sweetgum leaves are lustrous and bright green above and paler beneath. The wood of this tree is used to make furniture.",http://blogs.reed.edu/trees/files/2013/08/IMG_0388-american-sweetgum-e1411081979730.jpg,45.47938732,-122.6295769,Liquidambar styraciflua

American Sycamore,Platanus occidentalis,Platanus,Platanaceae,"Also known as the Buttonwood, Buttonball tree, and American Planetree, this tree is native to the eastern U.S., south to northern Florida and Texas. Leaves are 3 and sometimes 5-lobed, flat medium green in summer; fall color is tan to brown. The hard wood of the American Sycamore is often used for butcher blocks. Its bark is distinctive: on older trees it peels and flakes, leaving a lighter underbark. This tree can reach enormous heights of 150 feet in its native habitat and up to 100 feet in the city. It is one parent of the London Plane tree.",http://blogs.reed.edu/trees/files/2013/09/PLOC1_lg.jpg,45.47949453,-122.6337351,Platanus occidentalis

The Europeans have grown, appreciated, and selected superior forms of this tree, while some Americans treat it as a weed. A native of the central and southern Appalachian Mountains, it has naturalized in much of the Pacific Northwest. Its wood is highly resistant to decay and is often used for fenceposts. In addition to the trees shown on these maps, there is a row of old black locusts along the north edge of the Reed canyon, between the footbridge and the springs.

Black Locust,Robinia pseudoacacia,Robinia,Fabaceae,"Often an upright tree with a straight trunk, the black locust becomes ragged and scraggly with age. The leaf color is dull, dark blue-green with leaves showing a slight yellow-green in fall.

This species is very old; in the days of the dinosaurs Ginkgos covered the temperate world.The two largest and most prominent Ginkgos on the Reed campus are located on the main campus driveway, just to the west of the library. These trees, which are over 60 years old, were originally planted in the campus arboretum, where Vollum Hall now stands. In early 1940 they were transplanted to their present location, which at that time was the main library entrance. Writing in the February 1940 issue of the Reed College Notes, Biology professor Demorest Davenport described them as “naked Christmas trees.” (The full text of Davenport’s article is also available on-line.)

Many of the cultivars originated many years ago in Japan.‘Akebono’ – In 1920 the W. B. Clarke & Co. nursery in San Jose, California, introduced a new seedling called ‘Akebono’, which has had wide distribution and is very popular. As Japanese Flowering Cherries go, the Akebono can become quite large. Its blossoms are a delicate pink color; they make the tree look like a cloud in the spring.‘Kwanzan’ – The Kwanzan Cherry is ornamental, producing large, double, rosy-pink, pendant clusters of blooms. It is planted along many of Portland’s streets. ‘Shirotae’ – This beautiful, spreading cherry with fragrant, snow white flowers is also called `Mt. Fuji.’ It is easy to spot at any time of the year because of its low horizontal growth pattern.",http://blogs.reed.edu/trees/files/2013/09/PRSE1_lg.jpg,45.48121192,-122.6318545,

Tulip Tree,Liriodendron tulipifera,Liriodendron,Magnoliaceae,"“[He] proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip-tree, which stood, with some eight or ten oaks, upon the level, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees which I had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in the wide spread of its branches, and in the general majesty of its appearance.”– Edgar Allan Poe, “The Gold-Bug” As Poe described, the tulip tree is an impressive species that can reach up to 200 feet. Typically, it has a straight trunk, and the dark green leaves are almost square in shape. The beautiful flowers are yellow-green and shaped like tulips, but difficult to see because they blend with the foliage. The leaves seem to attract insects and large numbers of bees can be found in the foliage in the summertime (which may have been one source of inspiration for Poe’s tale). Tulip trees are native to eastern North America.",http://blogs.reed.edu/trees/... <truncated>,45.48072446,-122.6282908,
