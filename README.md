This repository contains source code for the course website for Math 141: Introduction to Probability and Statistics at Reed College, Spring 2026.

The website was created with Quarto, adapted from the website Professor Grayson White created for last semester's course (thank you Grayson!). Much inspiration, styling, and formatting was drawn from UC Berkeley's [Stat 20 website](https://www.stat20.org/).
