    "text": "Learning Outcomes\nIn this course, you will learn how to think critically with data by engaging in the entire data analysis process through theory, computation, and practice. While most of our time will be spent learning techniques related to the Exploration and Visualization step and the Modeling and Inference step, you will also practice the other important components of analyzing data. Furthermore, since computation is an integral part of modern statistical work, you will learn to write R code – leveraging the RStudio user interface – to analyze data and will become familiar with several tidyverse R packages. You will also develop a reproducible and shareable workflow by using Quarto documents for all analyses.\nBy the end of the course, you will have improved your data acumen and your ability to think statistically. More concretely, you will be better able to accomplish the following tasks, which have been broken down by steps of the data analysis workflow:\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion formulation:\n\nTranslate a research problem into a set of questions that can be answered with data.\nFormulate data questions as measurable statements about statistics and parameters.\n\nData acquisition:\n\nDetermine the necessary data to conduct analyses.\nReflect on how design structures and data collection impact potential conclusions.\nIdentify potential ethical concerns surrounding data collection and data privacy.\n\nData wrangling:\n\nExplore datasets to determine what wrangling may be required (e.g., removing missing values, filtering out variables or observations, collapsing categories of a categorical variable).\nApply basic data wrangling operations.\n\nExploration and Visualization:\n\nUnderstand key principles of designing and creating effective data visualizations.\nCreate graphs from data, and appropriately draw conclusions from graphs.\nCompute and interpret summary statistics.\n\nModeling and Inference:\n\nUnderstand and be able to explain key probabilistic and inferential concepts, such as, sampling, variability, random variables, distributions, confidence, and significance.\nUse probability theory and data to recognize patterns and associations between variables.\nCreate and assess the appropriateness of linear regression models for a given problem and set of data.\nAppropriately apply and draw inferences from a statistical analysis using both simulation-based and theory-based methods, including quantifying and interpreting the uncertainty in model estimates.\nConsider the ethical implications of various modeling practices.\n\nCommunicating Findings:\n\nDevelop a reproducible workflow using Quarto documents.\nInterpret and communicate results of statistical analyses effectively for both a statistical and a non-statistical audience.\nBe able to reflect on the data involved in an analysis and show a curiosity for other ways of examining and thinking about the data."

    "section": "Policies",
    "text": "Policies\nLate work policy:\nTo help with various circumstances (expected and unexpected), you have up to 4 additional lab extensions days and 4 additional homework extension days that you can use as you need, no questions asked. You are free to distribute the extension days to different assignments as you wish (e.g., 1 additional day for 4 labs, 4 additional days for 1 lab) but the extension days must be rounded up to the nearest day (e.g., 2 extra hours = 1 extension day). Lab extension days may only be used for lab assignments, and homework extension days may only be used for homework assignments. When you use extension days, it may take longer for you to receive feedback on that assignment.\nIf you need to use any extension days, send Megan an email (not a Slack message) with the title: “Math 141 Extension Days” that includes the assignment that you are using an extension for, and the number of day(s) used.\nIf you have used all of your extension days and submit an additional assignment late, you may still submit your assignment (via Gradescope, or email if the Gradescope assignment is closed) for a grade worth up to 50% of the maximum possible grade of the original assignment. For example, if a lab is worth 100 points, and you submit it late without using extension days, your maximum possible grade for that assignment will be 50 points. It may take several weeks for assignments to be graded in these cases, and detailed feedback will not be given.\nCollaboration Policy and Academic Honesty:\nWorking with your classmates on difficult and interesting problems can not only help your learning, but also help you get to know each other! Therefore, I highly encourage you to collaborate on assignments, but, every piece of work you do must be your own. Copying and pasting other people’s work or code is not acceptable. The Honor Principle must guide your conduct in this class.\nIf you choose to collaborate with a classmate, you must add their name to the top of your assignment, and list them as a collaborator, e.g.:\nCollaborator(s): Michael Pearce, Lenny Wainstein, Grayson White\nBut what is collaboration?:\nFor Math 141, collaboration can look like: working with classmates together on a given problem, doing scratch work, helping each other get un-stuck on a part of a problem, and even coming to a solution. However, you must write up your own problem solutions individually and cannot copy other’s solutions (even those who you have collaborated with). Further, copying code from a collaborator, classmate, or generative AI tool (see the following section) is strictly prohibited.\nAI Policy:\nArtificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Co-Pilot, Gemini, and others are being used to generate code, analyze data, and much more. However, learning to think critically about a problem at hand, and engaging with your peers, tutors, and instructors when not understanding a concept or question are integral components of a liberal arts education. Further, a key goal of this course is for you to learn how to thoughtfully, ethically, and independently extract knowledge from data and engage in statistical reasoning. Therefore, the use of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and others, are strictly prohibited in any stage of the work process for this course. If you have questions about whether a tool is allowed for this course, ask the Instructor before using it."

They’re also a great place to get help on problems that you are stuck on.\nCourse Assistant office hours are a great place to work on your assignments with fellow students and seek the help of the course assistants whenever you get stuck.\n\nFurther, each Reed student is entitled to one hour of individual tutoring per course per week. You can sign up for individual tutoring in IRIS."

    "text": "Accessing this Lab on RStudio Server\nIn order to access the lab each week, you’ll have to follow these steps. Here, we detail the process of logging in to the RStudio Server and uploading a .zip file with the lab materials.\n\nFind today’s date on the course website home page calendar. Click “DOWNLOAD LAB.” This will download a .zip file to your computer.\nUse your web browser to navigate to the Reed RStudio server at https://rstudio.reed.edu.\nLog-in using your Reed username and password (the one you use for Moodle, Gmail, etc.).\nClick on the “Upload” button in the lower right quadrant in the RStudio screen.\n\n\n\n\nClick upload in RStudio to upload the lab files onto RStudio Server.\n\n\n\nClick on “Choose File” under “File to upload.” Find where the .zip file from step 1 downloaded onto your computer (usually the “Downloads” folder), select it, and hit “Open.”\nYou should be back in the RStudio window. If you want, you can change the “Target Directory” to be a “New Folder” called something like Math141. You will have ~10 other lab folders, so you can plan for them to all live there together if you want. Otherwise, click “OK.”\nYou should now see files in the bottom right quadrant of RStudio, near where you clicked “Upload.” Open the “lab01” folder to see its contents.\n\n\n\n\nFind your lab01 files in the bottom right quadrant of RStudio.\n\n\n\nOpen lab01_yournamehere.qmd. This is the Quarto document that you’ll complete the lab in. You can (and should) rename this file to include your actual name by checking the box next to the file, clicking “Rename”, and modifying the text to include your name, e.g. lab01_meganayers.qmd, rather than lab01_yournamehere.qmd.\n\n\n\n\nRename the lab .qmd file using your name.\n\n\n\nFinally, being sure to go back to the lab01 folder if you moved around at all, click on the gear symbol next to “More”. This is again in the lower right quadrant of Rstudio. Then, click “Set As Working Directory.” This tells R where to find files and data relative to your .qmd file. If you ever encounter an error where RStudio is complaining that it can’t find something, a good first check is to make sure you’ve done this step.\n\n\n\n\nSet the working directory to be lab01."
